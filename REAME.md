# Personal repo for random experiments in pytorch

Some experiments exploring pytorch and pytorch-lightning

---

## Available experiments
- MNIST classifier using a simple CNN without torch-lightning
- " with torch-lightning
- DCGAN on MNIST

## TODO (ideas)
- LSTM
- LSTM with batchnorm
- WGAN
- ResNet with GradCAM

---

## Currently "side features" working
- Auto saving models


## TODO
- Make tensorboard work
